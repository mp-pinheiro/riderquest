			[Ancient]: Let's go, I said!

			Black Car: Get rid of them.
			You: NO! DAD!

			Voice: They still don't have it...\. I couldn't give it to them.
			Voice: Son.\. You have to keep it safe.\. They must not have it.
			Voice: You must protect it. Find [Friend]...
			
		[Ancient]'s house
			You: D-dad...
			[Ancient]: You are up, my child, I was worried.
			You: Mom and dad, what... what happened?
			[Ancient]: It's time, son. It's time for you to learn the truth.
			You: I... I don't understand...
			[Ancient]: Those men that attacked your home, they are not common bandits.
			[Ancient]: Those are the Black Tires. An elite force that works directly under the King's authority.
			[Ancient]: Long ago, way before you came into this world.\^ Before your father met your mother and settled in this villagem he was one of them.
			You: But my father hated the kingdom...
			[Ancient]: It wasn't always like this. 
			[Ancient]: I worked in the kingdom as a blacksmith, forging engines for the King. Your father and I were close friends.
			[Ancient]: We used to meet every week.\^ He'd come to collect the engines and see to my payment.
			[Ancient]: One day, however, he didn't come. I thought it to be strange, as he never once missed a day, or was late.
			[Ancient]: But I didn't think much of it.
			[Ancient]: The next week he didn't show again.\^ Nor the next.\^ Instead, a different man came on the third week to collect the engines. 
			[Ancient]: He paid me for everything, and when I asked where your father went, or why they didn't come on the passing weeks, he told me schedule was tight, and he didn't know who your father was.
			[Ancient]: On the following day, I received a misterious letter telling me to go to the town square in the middle of night. \^It was your father's hand writting.
			You: I...\. that is all so strange...
			[Ancient]: When I got there, your father was waiting for me. He had a worried look in his eyes, and held a strange package. He was with a man I hadn't seen before.
			[Ancient]: There, he introduced to his friend [Friend], and they told me the world was in great danger.
			[Ancient]: They told me in that package was an amulet of great power. That the king used dark and untold arts to create this amuled. \^That he seeked to become a god.
			[Ancient]: I didn't understand at the time, \^but I trusted your father.
			[Ancient]: He asked me to change his car color, so he wouldn't be recognized. So I did.
			[Ancient]: On the following night, we met your mother on the east gate of the city, and she led us through a secret passage outside.
			[Ancient]: Once we got out, your father gave the amulet to [Friend]. He was told to hide it, and come back to the kingdom. As for me, your father and your mother, we ran away to this village.
			You: It's all about the amulet, then... \.My dreams...\. they...
			[Ancient]: If the Black Tires find the amulet, the world will be in great danger. 
			You: I must find it. My father, he was talking to me in my dreams.
			[Ancient]: I cannot tell you not to go, child. But if you must, know that it will be dangerous.
			[Ancient]: I knew this moment would come one day, but as time passed, and I got older, for a couple of sweet moments, I thought it wouldn't.
			[Ancient]: In the basement you can find everything I gathered in preparation for this day. But now I am old, and weak, it is of no use to me.
			[Ancient]: Take it, child. Find [Friend] and protect the amulet!
			You: I will! My father's death will not be in vain!
			
			{Player Receives Control}

		[Friend's] House
			Getting to it, you see that the door is locked.
			There is a lot of unread mail stuffing the mail box.
			
			You: Look at all that mail. He hasn't been home for a while.
			Stranger: Hey kid! You lost or something?
			
			Stranger car walks towards you.
			
			Stranger: Hi, sorry if I startled you. I saw that you were looking around old [Friend]'s houd. I'm his brother, [Stranger], what can I help you with?
			You: You're [Friend]'s brother? /^Where can I find him??, I need to speak to him, he's a friend of my father.
			[Stranger]: A friend of your... /.wait a minute...!/. [Name]!? Holy Delorian, I haven't seen you since you were just a Mini Cooper!
			You: I... do you know me and my father? I'm sorry, I don't recognize you.
			[Stranger]: Of course you don't, you were just a baby last time you saw me. But then, if you're here... that must mean it's happening.
			You: Yes. My house was attacked a couple of days ago. They took my mother... /^Father tried to protect us, but they were three against one... 
			[Stranger]: Your father was a brave man. Come one, let's talk inside.
			
			[Stranger] comes closer to the door, an unlocking sound is heard. Scenary changes to the inside of an abandoned house, you and [Strange] are sitting on a table.
			
			[Stranger]: Things have been rough here in the capital. Guards are guarding the entrance to the city, people are being inquired to go in and out, and all sorts of things.
			[Stranger]: They're trying to do things under the sheets, but it's still obvious.
			[Stranger]: My brother knew something was fishy when the Black Tires started to search down houses and interrogate people.
			[Stranger]: He gathered resources and went out to go warn your father, tell him to run away with you and your mother as soon as possible, but they got him on the way out.
			You: What...? /^How could they know?
			[Stranger]: I don't know. But they sure as hell did. Now my brother is sitting on a jail cell.
			[Stranger]: I've been thinkering a plan to rescue him, but it's complicated. The old dungeon floor has direct access to the prison, but it's sealed shut and guarded day and night.
			You: I happen to have a friend that can help us. He's an experienced thief, I bet he'll know what to do.
			[Stranger]: That's great news. I'll try to gather some information. Thanks for the help, [Name]. The world depends on us.
			You: Let's not let it down!
			
		[Inn]
			Before talking to [Stranger]
				The inn is a mixture of tavern and hotel. There are two floors, the first has a balcony to order food, drink or rent rooms, and a number of tables and seats occupied by different vehicles. The second floor has the rooms that can be rented.
				[GC] is sitted on one of the tables.
				
				Talking to him
					[GC]: What's up, dog.
					You: I'm trying to find a person named [Friend]. He's a friend of my father, and I desperately need to talk to him.
					[GC]: Hm. I see. The capital is a big city, but I'd try the Town Plaza. There are a lot of houses there, you might get lucky.
					You: Ok, thanks.
					
			After talking to [Stranger]
				You enter the inn and see [GC] talking to a red sports car.
				
				[GC]: I paid my part, man, now you keep your promise.
				Red Car: I don't think so, dude. There's something called interest, you know what that is? It's been far too long. You still owe me.
				[GC}: This is getting ridiculous, [RC]. Everytime I pay you, you come up with some new crap I gotta do.
				Red Car: You are not in a situation to make demands, pal. You do what I say, that's final.
				[GC]: Look, if you're not gonna bail her out, I quit! /^I'm just working for free, dude.
				Red Car: You ditch me, and she stays there forever.
				Red Car: Be there. Tomorrow, midnight, come alone. You know the drill.
				[GC]: ...
				
				[RC] leaves the inn.
				
				{Player Receives Control}
					Objective: Talk to [GC].
					
				You: Hey, [GC]. Is everything okay?
				[GC]: Not really, man, not really. I'm on a bumpy ride right now.
				You: What's happening? I'm sorry, I couldn't help but listen, what was that guy talking about?
				[GC]: That's [RC]. That guy is shady business, dude. My sister got hooked up on some nasty crap, man, NOZ galons, pink Neon Lights, some pretty heavy stuff. [RC]'s the guy dealing all that junk here in the capital.
				[GC]: She got messed up because of that crap, and asked for my help. She worked hard and got herself clean, but we owed a lot of money to [RC].
				[GC]: So we made a deal. I agreed working for him, in exchange that he didn't hurt my sister. As a condition, she has to work on his "business", so I don't "try anything funny". She mostly just delivers products.
				You: I understand now. \^I came here to ask for your help, but it seems like we need to deal with that [RC] guy first.
				[GC]: We can't, man. If we do anything, he's gonna hurt [Sister].
				You: I have a plan. \^I met the person I was looking for, he's a friend. Follow me, I'll introduce you guys.
				
				Fades out to [Friend's] house.
			
		[Friend's] house
			[Stranger]: It's taking too long, isn't it?
			[GC]: They work exactly by the books, if you catch my drift.
			You: She'll be here soon, I know it.
			
			Door knocks. [Stranger] walks over and opens it, a light blue car enters with two sports orange cars.
			
			Orange Car: [GC]! I knew something was fishy about this abandoned house delivery.
			You: You, let her go!
			[Sister]: [GC] leave it alone, the're gonna hurt you!

			[Stranger]: Things are going to be even harder now. Are you sure [RC] won't contact authorities?
			[GC]: The guy's dirty as hell, he's not gonna want cops sniffing around. We're fine.
			[Stranger]: Ok then, with [Sister] safe in my wife's house, we can go forward with your plan, [GC].
			[GC]: It's pretty straight forward. We break into the old dungeon using the sewer path. It's gonna smell like crap and be infested with rats, but's it's never guarded.
			[GC]: There is a trapdoor leading to it, and is locked, but you can leave that to me.
			[GC]: The path to the trapdoor is the tricky part. It's heavily guarded. We'll have to sneak past them, then the rest is easy.

		[Friend]'s house
			[Friend]: I was too late...
			[Friend]: Damn it!
			[Friend]: I should've been more careful. I'm sorry, [Name], I couldn't protect you. Or your family.
			You: It's okay, [Friend]. You did the best you could. Now is not the time to mourn, thoug. What is the amulet? Why is the king so interested in it.
			[Friend]: Back when me and your father were part of the Black Tires, the king sent us on strange missions across the land to find strange artifacts.
			[Friend]: We traveled all around the world searching for each piece, doing whatever it took to get hold of them.
			[Friend]: Then one day your father came to me with a piece of paper. It was an ancient document, describing the creation of the amulet. A device so powerful no man should ever control. And we were fetching all the pieces to craft it.
			[GC]: Wow... how powerful is a device that no man should ever control?
			[Friend]: Too powerful.
			[Friend]: The amulet, when complete and charged, gives the person holding the power to control any car.
			[Stranger]: Control of the mind...
			[Friend]: Yes. A person would be next to you, moving, but you'd never know if that's her will.
			You: That is saddistic.
			[Friend]: We were shocked it first, but it all made sense then. The king is a strange person, and his lust for power was always appearent, but we never thought he'd go so far.
			[Friend]: So we agreed to stop him. We took the pieces that we had, and the unfinished amulet, and ran away.
			[Friend]: I hid the pieces and the amulet on the catacombs in [Dungeon3], so no one would find it.
			[Friend]: The rest is history.
			You: So we are safe, right? The king doensn't know where the pieces are.
			[Friend]: I wish it was that simple.
			[Friend]: It's appearent by my imprisionament that someone is feeding information to the king.
			[Stranger]: I thought so too. They were quick to catch you just as you went out to warn [Name]'s family.
			You: But who could it be?
			[Friend]: I don't know.
			[Friend]: What I do know is that the amulet might not be safe. We were foolish to try and hide it. It should have been destroyed.
			[GC]: So this is how it ends, huh? We go on a sucide mission inside an ancient catacomb to destroy an ancient amulet. Sounds like fun.
			You: We must part as soon as possible.
			[Stranger]: But not unprepared. Let's all prepare for our journey. Come to me when you're ready to leave.
			[GC]: Cool.
			You: Let's do this.
				
			{Player Receives Control}

				Objective: Talk to [Friend] to go forward with the plan.

			You: D-dad...
			[Ancient]: You are up, my child, I was worried.
			You: Mom and dad, what... what happened?
			[Ancient]: It's time, son. It's time for you to learn the truth.
			You: I... I don't understand...
			[Ancient]: Those men that attacked your home, they are not common bandits.
			[Ancient]: Those are the Black Tires. An elite force that works directly under the King's authority.
			[Ancient]: Long ago, way before you came into this world.\^ Before your father met your mother and settled in this villagem he was one of them.
			You: But my father hated the kingdom...
			[Ancient]: It wasn't always like this. 
			[Ancient]: I worked in the kingdom as a blacksmith, forging engines for the King. Your father and I were close friends.
			[Ancient]: We used to meet every week.\^ He'd come to collect the engines and see to my payment.
			[Ancient]: One day, however, he didn't come. I thought it to be strange, as he never once missed a day, or was late.
			[Ancient]: But I didn't think much of it.
			[Ancient]: The next week he didn't show again.\^ Nor the next.\^ Instead, a different man came on the third week to collect the engines. 
			[Ancient]: He paid me for everything, and when I asked where your father went, or why they didn't come on the passing weeks, he told me schedule was tight, and he didn't know who your father was.
			[Ancient]: On the following day, I received a misterious letter telling me to go to the town square in the middle of night. \^It was your father's hand writting.
			You: I...\. that is all so strange...
			[Ancient]: When I got there, your father was waiting for me. He had a worried look in his eyes, and held a strange package. He was with a man I hadn't seen before.
			[Ancient]: There, he introduced to his friend [Friend], and they told me the world was in great danger.
			[Ancient]: They told me in that package was an amulet of great power. That the king used dark and untold arts to create this amuled. \^That he seeked to become a god.
			[Ancient]: I didn't understand at the time, \^but I trusted your father.
			[Ancient]: He asked me to change his car color, so he wouldn't be recognized. So I did.
			[Ancient]: On the following night, we met your mother on the east gate of the city, and she led us through a secret passage outside.
			[Ancient]: Once we got out, your father gave the amulet to [Friend]. He was told to hide it, and come back to the kingdom. As for me, your father and your mother, we ran away to this village.
			You: It's all about the amulet, then... \.My dreams...\. they...
			[Ancient]: If the Black Tires find the amulet, the world will be in great danger. 
			You: I must find it. My father, he was talking to me in my dreams.
			[Ancient]: I cannot tell you not to go, child. But if you must, know that it will be dangerous.
			[Ancient]: I knew this moment would come one day, but as time passed, and I got older, for a couple of sweet moments, I thought it wouldn't.
			[Ancient]: In the basement you can find everything I gathered in preparation for this day. But now I am old, and weak, it is of no use to me.
			[Ancient]: Take it, child. Find [Friend] and protect the amulet!
			You: I will! My father's death will not be in vain!

			Getting to it, you see that the door is locked.
			There is a lot of unread mail stuffing the mail box.
			
			You: Look at all that mail. He hasn't been home for a while.
			Stranger: Hey kid! You lost or something?
			
			Stranger car walks towards you.
			
			Stranger: Hi, sorry if I startled you. I saw that you were looking around old [Friend]'s houd. I'm his brother, [Stranger], what can I help you with?
			You: You're [Friend]'s brother? /^Where can I find him??, I need to speak to him, he's a friend of my father.
			[Stranger]: A friend of your... /.wait a minute...!/. [Name]!? Holy Delorian, I haven't seen you since you were just a Mini Cooper!
			You: I... do you know me and my father? I'm sorry, I don't recognize you.
			[Stranger]: Of course you don't, you were just a baby last time you saw me. But then, if you're here... that must mean it's happening.
			You: Yes. My house was attacked a couple of days ago. They took my mother... /^Father tried to protect us, but they were three against one... 
			[Stranger]: Your father was a brave man. Come one, let's talk inside.
			
			[Stranger] comes closer to the door, an unlocking sound is heard. Scenary changes to the inside of an abandoned house, you and [Strange] are sitting on a table.
			
			[Stranger]: Things have been rough here in the capital. Guards are guarding the entrance to the city, people are being inquired to go in and out, and all sorts of things.
			[Stranger]: They're trying to do things under the sheets, but it's still obvious.
			[Stranger]: My brother knew something was fishy when the Black Tires started to search down houses and interrogate people.
			[Stranger]: He gathered resources and went out to go warn your father, tell him to run away with you and your mother as soon as possible, but they got him on the way out.
			You: What...? /^How could they know?
			[Stranger]: I don't know. But they sure as hell did. Now my brother is sitting on a jail cell.
			[Stranger]: I've been thinkering a plan to rescue him, but it's complicated. The old dungeon floor has direct access to the prison, but it's sealed shut and guarded day and night.
			You: I happen to have a friend that can help us. He's an experienced thief, I bet he'll know what to do.
			[Stranger]: That's great news. I'll try to gather some information. Thanks for the help, [Name]. The world depends on us.
			You: Let's not let it down!
			
		[Inn]
			Before talking to [Stranger]
				The inn is a mixture of tavern and hotel. There are two floors, the first has a balcony to order food, drink or rent rooms, and a number of tables and seats occupied by different vehicles. The second floor has the rooms that can be rented.
				[GC] is sitted on one of the tables.
				
				Talking to him
					[GC]: What's up, dog.
					You: I'm trying to find a person named [Friend]. He's a friend of my father, and I desperately need to talk to him.
					[GC]: Hm. I see. The capital is a big city, but I'd try the Town Plaza. There are a lot of houses there, you might get lucky.
					You: Ok, thanks.
					
			After talking to [Stranger]
				You enter the inn and see [GC] talking to a red sports car.
				
				[GC]: I paid my part, man, now you keep your promise.
				Red Car: I don't think so, dude. There's something called interest, you know what that is? It's been far too long. You still owe me.
				[GC}: This is getting ridiculous, [RC]. Everytime I pay you, you come up with some new crap I gotta do.
				Red Car: You are not in a situation to make demands, pal. You do what I say, that's final.
				[GC]: Look, if you're not gonna bail her out, I quit! /^I'm just working for free, dude.
				Red Car: You ditch me, and she stays there forever.
				Red Car: Be there. Tomorrow, midnight, come alone. You know the drill.
				[GC]: ...
				
				[RC] leaves the inn.
				
				{Player Receives Control}
					Objective: Talk to [GC].
					
				You: Hey, [GC]. Is everything okay?
				[GC]: Not really, man, not really. I'm on a bumpy ride right now.
				You: What's happening? I'm sorry, I couldn't help but listen, what was that guy talking about?
				[GC]: That's [RC]. That guy is shady business, dude. My sister got hooked up on some nasty crap, man, NOZ galons, pink Neon Lights, some pretty heavy stuff. [RC]'s the guy dealing all that junk here in the capital.
				[GC]: She got messed up because of that crap, and asked for my help. She worked hard and got herself clean, but we owed a lot of money to [RC].
				[GC]: So we made a deal. I agreed working for him, in exchange that he didn't hurt my sister. As a condition, she has to work on his "business", so I don't "try anything funny". She mostly just delivers products.
				You: I understand now. \^I came here to ask for your help, but it seems like we need to deal with that [RC] guy first.

			[Stranger]: Things are going to be even harder now. Are you sure [RC] won't contact authorities?
			[GC]: The guy's dirty as hell, he's not gonna want cops sniffing around. We're fine.
			[Stranger]: Ok then, with [Sister] safe in my wife's house, we can go forward with your plan, [GC].
			[GC]: It's pretty straight forward. We break into the old dungeon using the sewer path. It's gonna smell like crap and be infested with rats, but's it's never guarded.
			[GC]: There is a trapdoor leading to it, and is locked, but you can leave that to me.
			[GC]: The path to the trapdoor is the tricky part. It's heavily guarded. We'll have to sneak past them, then the rest is easy.

			[GC]: Got it!

			Fades out to [Friend]'s house.
			
		[Friend]'s house
			[Friend]: I was too late...
			[Friend]: Damn it!
			[Friend]: I should've been more careful. I'm sorry, [Name], I couldn't protect you. Or your family.
			You: It's okay, [Friend]. You did the best you could. Now is not the time to mourn, thoug. What is the amulet? Why is the king so interested in it.
			[Friend]: Back when me and your father were part of the Black Tires, the king sent us on strange missions across the land to find strange artifacts.
			[Friend]: We traveled all around the world searching for each piece, doing whatever it took to get hold of them.
			[Friend]: Then one day your father came to me with a piece of paper. It was an ancient document, describing the creation of the amulet. A device so powerful no man should ever control. And we were fetching all the pieces to craft it.
			[GC]: Wow... how powerful is a device that no man should ever control?
			[Friend]: Too powerful.
			[Friend]: The amulet, when complete and charged, gives the person holding the power to control any car.
			[Stranger]: Control of the mind...
			[Friend]: Yes. A person would be next to you, moving, but you'd never know if that's her will.
			You: That is saddistic.
			[Friend]: We were shocked it first, but it all made sense then. The king is a strange person, and his lust for power was always appearent, but we never thought he'd go so far.
			[Friend]: So we agreed to stop him. We took the pieces that we had, and the unfinished amulet, and ran away.
			[Friend]: I hid the pieces and the amulet on the catacombs in [Dungeon3], so no one would find it.
			[Friend]: The rest is history.
			You: So we are safe, right? The king doensn't know where the pieces are.
			[Friend]: I wish it was that simple.
			[Friend]: It's appearent by my imprisionament that someone is feeding information to the king.
			[Stranger]: I thought so too. They were quick to catch you just as you went out to warn [Name]'s family.
			You: But who could it be?
			[Friend]: I don't know.
			[Friend]: What I do know is that the amulet might not be safe. We were foolish to try and hide it. It should have been destroyed.
			[GC]: So this is how it ends, huh? We go on a sucide mission inside an ancient catacomb to destroy an ancient amulet. Sounds like fun.
			You: We must part as soon as possible.
			[Stranger]: But not unprepared. Let's all prepare for our journey. Come to me when you're ready to leave.
			[GC]: Cool.
			You: Let's do this.
				
			{Player Receives Control}
				Objective (Optional): Buy things.
				Objective: Talk to [Friend] to go forward with the plan.
			
			Talking with [Friend]
